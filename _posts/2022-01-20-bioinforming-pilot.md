Our first free-of-charge training school in bioinformatics, ["Bioinforming - Pilot"](/training-school/bioinforming-pilot/) was held from the 10th to the 14th of January 2022 in Herceg Novi, Montenegro. 

Six high school students (five in-person and one online), two trainers and several observers with different backgrounds took part in the event. 

The training school covered the basics of bioinformatics with a focus on hands-on experience, allowing participants to gain both theoretical and practical knowledge. The contents were tailored to applicants’ interests and covered: 1) introduction, 2) molecular sequence analysis, 3) molecular phylogenetics, 4) protein structure analysis and 5) protein-ligand interactions. The participants applied their newly acquired knowledge by working together to solve a mystery case.

We also informed the participants about bioinformatics career paths and Erasmus+ mobility opportunities.

This training school was supported by [JUSMŠ “Ivan Goran Kovačić”](http://smsigkovacic.me/) (provided space and necessary equipment), [Organization of Montenegrins Studying Abroad](https://www.omsa.me/) (helped to distribute call for applications and [preliminary survey](/news/survey/)) and [Western Balkans Alumni Association](https://www.western-balkans-alumni.eu/) (provided funding).
