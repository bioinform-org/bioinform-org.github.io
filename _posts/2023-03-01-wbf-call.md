This spring we are organizing our first two training schools in bioinformatics for undegraduate students. The events will take place in Novi Sad (24-28th of April) and Skopje (8-12th May). Interested students can apply by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/QCtpXsVonYBmbZun9) for Novi Sad or [this form](https://forms.gle/dA2UxYmapSfMuU2R9) for Skopje.

As part of these training schools we will cover basic concepts in bioinformatics by integrating both theory and practice. Students will learn about the building blocks of life and how they can be studied using computational methods. By working together with their peers they will apply their newly acquired knowledge to solve engaging real-world problems.

This project has been funded by the Western Balkans Fund and European Union, under the Call for Regional Project Proposals, "Support to the Promotion of Civil Society regional activities in the Western Balkans".
