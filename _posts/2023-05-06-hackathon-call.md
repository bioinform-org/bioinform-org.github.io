We are excited to announce our upcoming hackathon exploring the world of plant resistance genes and machine learning! This 2-day event, which will be held on June 17th and 18th, provides a unique opportunity to work in interdisciplinary teams to build a machine learning model to identify potential plant resistance genes in a given plant species.

The hackathon will be held online and include a mix of lectures, hacking sessions and team collaboration. Participants will be provided with a dataset of known plant resistance genes, as well as tools and resources to help them build and evaluate their model. Experienced mentors will also be available to guide and assist throughout the event.

Interested students can apply by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/HGQWKsT5DbjVhE1j7). Successful applicants will receive further information and instructions on how to participate in the hackathon.

This project has been funded by the Western Balkans Fund and European Union, under the Call for Regional Project Proposals, "Support to the Promotion of Civil Society regional activities in the Western Balkans".
