Our first training school, called ["BioINForming - Pilot"](/training-school/bioinforming-pilot/), was held in January 2022 on the premises of [JUSMŠ "Ivan Goran Kovačić"](http://smsigkovacic.me/).
They dedicated us a page in the 63rd edition of their school journal ["Iskra"](http://smsigkovacic.me/?cat=3).

Firstly, we talked about how we discovered bioinformatics and how we chose to study it.
We explained why we chose their school as the venue, what tools were used in the training and who supported the event.
Finally, we discussed our plans for the future.

You can read the article on page 5 of the [journal](http://smsigkovacic.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ISKRA-63-web.pdf) (in Montenegrin).
