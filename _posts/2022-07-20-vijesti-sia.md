Our team "BioINForming" has been chosen among the 10 finalists for [Social Impact Award Montenegro](https://montenegro.socialimpactaward.net/) (SIA).
Journal "Vijesti" published an article about the SIA project and the teams that made it to the incubation phase.

Our idea consists in providing free educational content in bioinformatics to interested young students from all social backgrounds.
By mentoring a new generation of bioinformaticians we want to promote innovation and economic development in Montenegro.

You can read the whole article [on the website of the journal "Vijesti"](https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/drustvo/613672/socijalno-preduzetnistvo-u-povoju-za-svoj-dzep-ali-i-drustvo-u-cjelini) (in Montenegrin).
