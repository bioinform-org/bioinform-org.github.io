Following the success of the [second edition of BioINForming](/training-school/bioinforming-2.0/), we are thrilled to share the exciting news that BioINForming 3.0 is scheduled for January 2023! We invite high school students in Montenegro to join us by submitting their applications through [this form](https://forms.gle/znBFGPrewTF8PT7s5).

During our training school, students will have the opportunity to delve into the fascinating realms of molecular sequences, protein structures and the foundations of programming. Our comprehensive curriculum is designed to nurture their understanding of these critical concepts through hands-on experience.

We are committed to making every moment at BioINForming 3.0 an enriching and enjoyable one, fostering a passion for bioinformatics and scientific exploration.

This event is made possible through the support of the [Municipality of Herceg Novi](https://hercegnovi.me/).
