After our successful [first edition of BioINForming](/training-school/bioinforming-pilot/), we are happy to announce that in January of 2023 we are able to organize the second training school in bioinformatics! High school students in Montenegro can apply by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/Tx7UXyEV1WKotFMe7).

During our training school students will get introduced to topics such as DNA sequences and protein structures, while acquiring basic programming skills. We also have time for an optional topic that the students can pick from a list of available options. We aim to make learning fun, so students will have to solve challenges using bioinformatics tools. There is also a specific session dedicated to discussing career opportunities or a discussion about social issues, according to the students' interest.

We hope to see you there!

This event is made possible thanks to our sponsors - [Social Impact Award Montenegro](https://montenegro.socialimpactaward.net/) and the [Municipality of Herceg Novi](https://hercegnovi.me/).
