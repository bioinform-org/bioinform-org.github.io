We participated in the "PerICo spring training school" in Berlin, focused on career perspectives, as presenters of an example of an alternative career path in science.

We met 13 PhD students part of the PerICo consortium and shared our initiative about free-education promotion in science and bioinformatics. 

The presentation highlighted our challenges and successes in realising our [first training school](/training-school/bioinforming-pilot/) and how the Bioinform idea started.

PerICo is a multi-partner European Training Network under the European Union programme Horizon 2020 that involves 10 partner organisations and 15 students. PerICo fosters the education of these students in projects aimed at uncovering how peroxisomes, important cellular organelles, participate in the intricate cellular interaction and signalling network. More details about PerICo are available on [their website](https://itn-perico.eu/home/).

We received helpful feedback and donations from the participants, for which we are much obliged. We are grateful to [Lifeglimmer GmbH](https://www.lifeglimmer.com/) for hosting us on their premises and promoting our initiatives.

In connection with this event, we might be able to announce new members and new training schools soon; stay tuned.
