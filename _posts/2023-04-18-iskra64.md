The latest issue of the school journal "Iskra" featured an article on the endeavors of our non-governmental organization. Founded less than two years ago, our organization has been offering educational resources in bioinformatics to high school students across Montenegro. Thanks to the award we won at the "Social Impact Award Montenegro", we successfully organized our second training school, called ["BioINForming 2.0"](/training-school/bioinforming-2.0/), in January 2023 on the premises of [JUSMŠ "Ivan Goran Kovačić"](http://smsigkovacic.me/). The article also highlights the interest among Montenegrin students in bioinformatics education, emphasizing the importance of ongoing support for such initiatives.

You can read the full article on page 11 of the [journal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DnTI7G1k0l2CC5uAg0Gx0BWmmQTR0wIE/view) (in Montenegrin).
