<p><h2>Limitation of liability</h2></p>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Bioinform be liable for any special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the website, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the website or otherwise in connection with any provision of these terms and conditions), even if Bioinform has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>

<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

<p>The website is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind.

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
