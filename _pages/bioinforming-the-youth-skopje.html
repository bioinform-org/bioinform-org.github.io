    This training school has made me look at my future career in a brighter way. All the chances bioinformatics provides, play a crucial role in our future research and in pursuing different career paths in a more digital way.

  <blockquote style="border-left: none; border-right: 0.25em solid #006666; text-align: right;">
     The material that we learned was very well explained. The trainers were very friendly and approachable which made asking them questions about what I didn't understand super easy. I know that a lot of what I learned here is going to be useful in my career. This training school also gave me the chance to hang out with people from different Balkan ethnicities, something that I haven't had the opportunity to do before and that I enjoyed very much.

    The entire event was a wonderful experience and I am hoping to be able to be a part of a similar project by this organization again. Hopefully, there will be a lot more in the near future, perhaps with many different (general and specific) topics and for a much wider audience as I am sure there is no lack of interest in such events.
